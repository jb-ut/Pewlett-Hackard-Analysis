# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Purpose of the analysis was to identify the number of retiring employees based on job title. I was also tasked with identifying those people eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
1. Interstingly Holden High performed very well. It should be looked at as an example for schools under 100 students. 
2. Larger schools like Bailey High School and Roriguez High School need to review performance particularily in math.
3. Cabrera High School should had incredible results considereing that the studen tbody is over 1000/
4. Griffith High School had a near perfect average for Reading.

## Summary
Overall most woould think larger schools would perform better,but looking at the data reveals a different picture. Schools greater than 1000 students had many instances of sub-60% overall passing. Smaller schools performed very well. 

Additional Insight
1. Average years of experience for teachers.
2. School budget

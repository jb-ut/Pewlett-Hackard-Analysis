# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Purpose of the analysis was to identify the number of retiring employees based on job title. I was also tasked with identifying those people eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
1. There are more people retiring than there are mentors
2. Over a fourth of retirees are Senior Engineers
3. Less than 2000 people qualify for mentorship.
4. Senior engineers have a prioritized position for mentorships
